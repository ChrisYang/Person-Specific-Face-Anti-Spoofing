# Person-Specific-Face-Anti-Spoofing
### Introduction
		This project provides the codes used in the TIFS paper "Person Specific Face Anti-Spoofing with Subject Domain Adaptation".
		Different from previous works, we proposed to implement face anti-spoofing in person-specific manner, which means each subject
		is equipped with a unique classifier for distinguishing genuine and fake face images. Moreover, we considered a challenging case that 
		some subjects' fake face images are not available. Toward such a problem, we proposed a subject domain adaptation algorithm to 
		generate virtual samples for training. The experimental results proves the superiority of person-specific face anti-spoofing method compared
		with generic face anti-spoofing methods. Also, it is shown the proposed subject domain adaptation algorithm can generate virtual samples to 
		assist the training of person-specific classifiers.
