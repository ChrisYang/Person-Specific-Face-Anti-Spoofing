# Person-Specific-Face-Anti-Spoofing
### Introduction
This project provides the codes used in the TIFS paper "Person Specific Face Anti-Spoofing with Subject Domain Adaptation"[link](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7041231&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7041231).
Different from previous works, we proposed to implement face anti-spoofing in person-specific manner, which means each subject
is equipped with a unique classifier for distinguishing genuine and fake face images. Moreover, we considered a challenging case that 
some subjects' fake face images are not available. Toward such a problem, we proposed a subject domain adaptation algorithm to 
generate virtual samples for training. The experimental results proves the superiority of person-specific face anti-spoofing method compared
with generic face anti-spoofing methods. Also, it is shown the proposed subject domain adaptation algorithm can generate virtual samples to 
assist the training of person-specific classifiers.
